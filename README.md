### About Me

Hi, my name is Victor, I am a Brazilian software developer, I work mainly with Java for back-end applications such as Rest API and Micro-services architectures.
I am also interested in Python for Data Science and Machine Learning.

I see software development as more of a craft than a science and I like to think of myself as more of an inventor than an engineer or architect. 

- :wrench: Currently working on: developing a large-scale micro-services environment for one of Brazil's biggest e-commerces using Spring Boot.
- :books: Currently learning: I am currently studying [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io/), a light-weight Spring-like framework built with micro-service development in mind.

:medal: Some of what I consider my best work:
- [Generic CRUD](https://github.com/victorgcapone/generic-crud) 
  * A generic, extensible CRUD API that allows one to add new REST resources collections by implementing only the business logic 
  * It uses Micronaut's AOT-compilation and introspection capabilities, along with some clever REST URI's to automatically load and execute the relevant code for the resource
